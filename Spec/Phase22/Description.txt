Phase22 (Initiatives).
There is a new requirement to be able to link Initiatives (Which are tickects of type "Initiative") living in JIRA with Objectives in AIME app.
To support this we need to create a new mapping table in our database which will map primary key from 
okrt table with JIRA ticket ID (PM-929). The mapping table will be named "jira_link". In theory we will give teh ability to link any okrt table records irrespective of their typewith any ticket from JIRA


On top of that we need a API to perform linking and unlinking.

Then we need to update the UI in My OKRs section to show the linked Initiatives under the Objective header. We will reuse the 
Initiative card alrady developed for Business>Initiatives.

Then we need to update the Basic prompt to tell AIME about this new arrangement.

When AIME is asked to perform linking/unlinking, that detail must come in an addition KB file and tool schema
