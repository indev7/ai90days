Time range displayed on clock face, light, dark halves and emoji transition logic:
1. 12AM<current time<=6AM
    clock face must display tasks scheduled in time range 12AM to 12PM, sun on the left moon on the right
2. 6AM<current time<=12PM
    clock face must display tasks scheduled in time range 6AM to 6PM, sun on the left sun on the right
3. 12PM<current time<=6PM
    clock face must display tasks scheduled in time range 12PM to 12AM, moon on the left sun on the right
4. 6PM<current time<=12AM
    clock face must display tasks scheduled in time range 6PM to 6AM, moon on the left moon on the right

Always moon side in dark background color and sun side in light background color

Additional clarifications: 
1. The background transition must be revised every 6 hours (12AM, 6AM, 12PM, 6PM). 
2. At any given time, clock face must show a time period of 12 hours and the tasks scheduled during that period.
3. Background colors change based on emoji placement:
   - Left side: light background when sun, dark background when moon
   - Right side: light background when sun, dark background when moon
