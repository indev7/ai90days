Phase 11 - Time Blocking (Task Scheduling)
Need to introduce a new DB table to record time blocks.

The table must record task_id (primary key from OKRT table), user_id (from Users table), Start_Time, Duration (in minutes)

On top of the DB table, there needs to be API which can perform CRUD operations, list all tasks of a user on  given date. SECURITY CONSTRAINT: USER CAN ONLY SEE HIS/HER RECORDS
On the UI, There need to be a new link from leftMenu titled (Calendar) user icon:import { RiCalendarScheduleLine } from "react-icons/ri";. Calendar page should show days from Monday to SUnday in a table of columns (in the desktop version), In Mobile a single days column must be diplayed where the user can swipe left or right to reach other days.
On the left, time must be shown starting from 4AM upto 11PM. User can swipe upwards up to reveal upto 12AM or swipe down to reveal upto 12AM 

If you dowble click or double tap any where on the calendar a "Schedule" button must apear. Clcik elese where and button will get removed. If the buttton is pressed, then a modal with a drop down tasks list (status in todo or in-progress tasks must come here) will apear. Below the drop down another drop down with label "Allocate" and the drop down will list 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1h, 1h:30min, 2 hours, 3 hours,5h,6h,8h,12hours, all day
