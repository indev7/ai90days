I would like to add two new fields to Group table in the DB (use node scripts to update the Postgress DB and connection details are in .env.local)
new fieds 1. vision 2.mission

Then add them to the group details data section in mainTree under "groups" parent node. 
Also updaet teh API to fetch those two new group attributes

Also modify the create/update Group modal popup to include and save two new text filds with labels "Vision" and "Mission"
Add those above "Choose Strategic Obgectives" section
