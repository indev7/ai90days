Phase 8
Notifications

The user should get notifications in the case if any of the following events occur. 
Use Serverside events to implement this function.
Notification receiver must be built in to left menu (bell icon must show unread notification count). 
When clicked on notification menu link, user must see all notifications (most recent at the top). 
Make use of PrimeReact widgets when implementing this.
