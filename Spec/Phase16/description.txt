I would like to update the User table to include new column "Role"
With this new addition, I would like to introduce user roles: system will customize the UI and functionality accoring to role previlege.
These are the roles in the order of decending privilge:
1. Admin
2. Owner
3. Leader
4. User

"User" is the default previlege level. WHen creating new users by sign up or when Microsoft sign-in based user creation, set the Role to "User"

The Add group button must only be available to Leader, Owner, Admin

There is a user by the username "indev" set his Roe to Admin

Create new page to show user list and API to fecth User List (API must only be accessible by a user with Admin role)
When a user record is cliecked, it must open a modal popup to edit user details and set role froma drop down.
When an Admin user signs in, his left menu must show the following link: "Members" which will open Members page
