In addition to the existing 90Day clock component, 4 new components will be introduces. 
These 4 components must apear in same card dimensions. Rounded corners and border style must be similar to 
90 day clock. The new component tytles must be
1. Inspiration - A component to show inspirational quotes from successful role models
2. Notifications - A list of most recent Notifications
3. Today - A new clock face component similar to 90 day clock, but showing scheduled tasks for today
