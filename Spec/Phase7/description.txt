Phase 7 - Follow
Implement Follow function. The user can follow any OKRT shared in the groups to which he  belong.
Need a simple Mapping table 
Follow table
Id
user_id
objective_id
In the Shared Goals page, on cards that are not owned by current user, display a follow button. 
If already following, show the card in a different background color and button label should be Unfollow. 
Objective cards that are being followed must come at the top.
