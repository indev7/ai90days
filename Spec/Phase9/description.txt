Phase 9: Comments
Need to implement a comment function. 
A comment is related to a OKRT record. For example a supervisor can comment on a subordinates OKRT or send a congratulatory comment when a KR is achieved. 
Need to introduce a new DB table

Comments table
id
comment
parent_comment_id
type (text/medals/cookie/star)
count 
sending_user
receiving_user
time_stamp

Generally the comment type is “text”, 
occasionally the same table will be used to record when one user sends tokens of appreciation of type medal, cookie or star. 
In such cases, the count column records the number of medals,cookies or stars given. The maximum count cannot be more than 5 at a time. 
Sending user and receiving user's user_id's from Users table will be recorded in the comments table. 
Any user who can view a OKRT can also view its related comments. 
Else cannot see any other comments.

parent_comment_id must be used when a comment is in reply to another comment.

Need an API to perform CRUD operations on comments table. A user must be able to view comments given by him, comments given to one of his OKRTs or comments given to an OKRT that is shared with him. 
 
On the UI,   
User can comment his own OKRTs, reply to a comment given to one of his OKRTs or to a comment   given to one of the OKRTs shared with him. 

Under the KR cards in app/okrt/page.js, add a new UI components to show comments with a new comment button or send reward (reward types can be cookie, medal, star and the number can be selected). if there are any. Width of this component must be same as the Objective header component. This will become visible together with KR cards if the Objective is expanded.
