Need the following amendments:
Left Menu must show Text labels. Shared with me should change to Shared Goals. Icon for Profile should be a upticking chart. My Goals icon should be a Trophy. Shared Goals Icon should be a Trophy in between two persons. New, Coach, Settings must come to the bottom. 90 day logo image must be displayed to its original dimensions without reducing size. It must align more towards left. No neeed to display 90Days in purple text after that. Do not display Day 1 in the header (remove it)



Fix following Bug:
1. When I logged in to a new Firefox browser with already created email password combination, after I logged in, the header shows sign-in. It should be welcome text and profile image.
2. Left Menu must not show before log in. Before sign in a different page must be shown without header and menu with Logo promnantly displayed
