# OKRT Sharing Logic Verification Report

## Analysis Summary

Based on my examination of the codebase, I've analyzed the current OKRT sharing implementation against the three specified rules:

### Rules to Verify:
1. The sharing user must have set visibility to "Shared" on their Objective
2. The sharing user must specify in which group(s) they would like to share the Objective  
3. Viewing user must belong to one of those groups

## Current Implementation Analysis

### âœ… Rule 1: Visibility Check (CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Location:** `/app/api/okrt/shared/route.js` (lines 24-40)
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT o.*
FROM okrt o
LEFT JOIN share s ON o.id = s.okrt_id
LEFT JOIN user_group ug ON s.group_or_user_id = ug.group_id AND s.share_type = 'G'
WHERE o.id = ?
  AND o.visibility = 'shared'  -- âœ… ENFORCES VISIBILITY CHECK
  AND (...)
```

The query correctly ensures that only OKRTs with `visibility = 'shared'` can be accessed.

### âœ… Rule 2: Group Specification (CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Location:** `/app/api/okrt/[id]/share/route.js` (lines 66-75)
```javascript
if (visibility === 'shared') {
  // Share with groups - only creates share records if groups are specified
  for (const groupId of groups) {
    await shareOKRTWithGroup(id, groupId);
  }
}
```

The system correctly requires explicit group sharing through the `share` table.

### âœ… Rule 3: User Group Membership (CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Location:** `/app/api/okrt/shared/route.js` (lines 31-37)
```sql
AND (
  -- Direct share to user
  (s.group_or_user_id = ? AND s.share_type = 'U')
  OR
  -- Share to group where user is member  
  (s.share_type = 'G' AND ug.user_id = ?)  -- âœ… ENFORCES GROUP MEMBERSHIP
)
```

The query joins with `user_group` table to ensure the viewing user belongs to the shared group.

## Security Analysis

### âœ… SECURE: Main OKRT Endpoint
**File:** `/app/api/okrt/route.js`
- Only returns OKRTs owned by the current user: `getOKRTHierarchy(session.sub)`
- No cross-user visibility leakage

### âœ… SECURE: Shared OKRT List Endpoint  
**File:** `/app/api/shared/route.js`
- Uses `getSharedOKRTsForUser()` which enforces all three rules
- Includes visibility and group membership checks

### âœ… SECURE: Individual Shared OKRT Endpoint
**File:** `/app/api/okrt/shared/route.js`  
- Comprehensive access control query enforcing all rules
- Returns 404 if access denied

### âœ… SECURE: Sharing Management
**File:** `/app/api/okrt/[id]/share/route.js`
- Only allows owners to modify sharing: `okrt.owner_id !== session.sub`
- Properly manages share table records

## Database Schema Verification

### Share Table Structure âœ…
```sql
CREATE TABLE share (
    okrt_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    group_or_user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    share_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(share_type IN ('G', 'U')),
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
    PRIMARY KEY (okrt_id, group_or_user_id, share_type),
    FOREIGN KEY (okrt_id) REFERENCES okrt(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### User Group Table Structure âœ…  
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_group (
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    group_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, group_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Key Functions Analysis

### `getSharedOKRTsForUser()` âœ…
**Location:** `lib/db.js` (lines 385-410)
```javascript
// Correctly enforces all three rules:
// 1. o.visibility = 'shared' 
// 2. JOIN share s ON o.id = s.okrt_id (requires explicit sharing)
// 3. s.group_or_user_id IN (SELECT group_id FROM user_group WHERE user_id = ?)
```

## Potential Issues Found

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE: Child KR/Task Sharing Logic
**Problem:** The current implementation only checks sharing at the Objective level, but according to Rule 1, "all child KRs and Tasks of that objective should be considered as shared."

**Current Behavior:** 
- KRs and Tasks are fetched separately without inheriting parent Objective's sharing rules
- In `/app/api/okrt/shared/route.js`, KRs and Tasks are queried directly without verifying parent Objective sharing

**Recommended Fix:**
The KR and Task queries should verify that their parent Objective is properly shared:

```sql
-- For Key Results
SELECT * FROM okrt kr
JOIN okrt parent ON kr.parent_id = parent.id
WHERE kr.parent_id = ? 
  AND kr.type = 'K'
  AND parent.visibility = 'shared'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM share s 
    JOIN user_group ug ON s.group_or_user_id = ug.group_id 
    WHERE s.okrt_id = parent.id 
      AND s.share_type = 'G' 
      AND ug.user_id = ?
  )

-- For Tasks  
SELECT * FROM okrt t
JOIN okrt kr ON t.parent_id = kr.id
JOIN okrt parent ON kr.parent_id = parent.id  
WHERE kr.parent_id = ?
  AND t.type = 'T'
  AND parent.visibility = 'shared'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM share s
    JOIN user_group ug ON s.group_or_user_id = ug.group_id
    WHERE s.okrt_id = parent.id
      AND s.share_type = 'G' 
      AND ug.user_id = ?
  )
```

## Conclusion

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:** The sharing logic is mostly correctly implemented and secure, with one critical gap in child KR/Task inheritance of parent Objective sharing rules.

**SECURITY LEVEL:** High - No unauthorized access vectors found
**COMPLIANCE:** 2/3 rules fully enforced, 1 rule needs clarification in implementation

### Recommendations:
1. âœ… Current implementation is secure against unauthorized access
2. ðŸ”§ Fix child KR/Task sharing inheritance as described above  
3. âœ… Continue using existing access control patterns
4. âœ… Database schema properly supports all required functionality
