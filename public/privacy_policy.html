      <h1>AIME Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: 2026-01-29</p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the AIME web application collects, uses, shares,
        and protects personal data when you use AIME, our internal workplace goal-setting
        and execution-visibility application.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Who this policy applies to</h2>
      <p>
        AIME is intended for internal staff of Intervest (and, where applicable,
        affiliated group companies). This policy applies to authorised users who access AIME.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Controller and contact details</h2>
      <p>Intervest is the controller for personal data processed in AIME.</p>
      <address>
        Intervest (Pvt) Ltd<br />
        Data Protection Officer, Risk &amp; Compliance Department<br />
        Level 23, 324 Havelock Road, Colombo 006, Sri Lanka<br />
        Email: <a href="mailto:info@intervest.lk">info@intervest.lk</a><br />
        Phone: <a href="tel:+94112081880">+94 112 081 880</a>
      </address>
      <p>
        If your local entity is a joint controller for certain processing, we will provide
        a supplemental notice where required.
      </p>

      <h2>3. What data AIME processes</h2>
      <p>AIME may process the following categories of personal data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Account and identity data: name, work email/login identifier, employee identifier (if used), authentication/session identifiers.</li>
        <li>Organisation data: department/team, role (User/Leader/Owner/Admin), reporting line and organisational structure attributes needed for RBAC.</li>
        <li>Goal and collaboration data: objectives, key results, tasks/initiatives, time blocks, progress updates, comments, and related timestamps and ownership.</li>
        <li>Usage and technical data: IP address, device/browser information, login events, and diagnostic logs (to secure and operate the service).</li>
        <li>Integration references (where enabled): identifiers and metadata from Jira and KPI systems (e.g., issue keys, assignee identifiers, KPI identifiers), scoped by permissions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Special category data and sensitive information</h2>
      <p>
        AIME is not designed for recording special category data (e.g., health information,
        biometrics, religious or political beliefs, trade union membership, sexual orientation).
        Users should not enter such information into AIME free-text fields (e.g., comments) or
        into Jira tickets via AIME. If such data is incidentally included, we will minimise
        processing, restrict access, and handle it in line with applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>5. How we collect data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Directly from you when you create or update goals, tasks, comments, and time blocks.</li>
        <li>From enterprise systems you already use, when you connect AIME (e.g., Microsoft SSO for identity; Jira for ticket information; Snowflake or KPI sources for reporting), scoped by permissions.</li>
        <li>Automatically through system operation (security logs and technical telemetry).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Purposes of processing</h2>
      <p>We process personal data in AIME to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide AIME’s functionality for 90-day goal planning, tracking, dashboards, and collaboration.</li>
        <li>Enforce security and access control (authentication, RBAC, fraud/abuse prevention).</li>
        <li>Integrate with workplace systems (e.g., Jira for work items and Snowflake/KPI sources for reporting), where enabled.</li>
        <li>Provide an AI-assisted interface to draft OKRs, answer questions, and propose actions to save time (with user Accept/Reject controls).</li>
        <li>Operate, troubleshoot, and improve AIME (including defect handling and service reliability).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Lawful bases (EU/UK)</h2>
      <p>
        Where EU/UK data protection laws apply (e.g., GDPR / UK GDPR), we rely on one or more
        lawful bases, depending on the processing context:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Performance of a contract/workplace administration (Art. 6(1)(b)): operating internal tools that staff use as part of their work.</li>
        <li>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)): operating, securing, and improving AIME, and providing execution visibility and coordination across teams, balanced against user rights and expectations.</li>
        <li>Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c)) where applicable: responding to data subject rights requests or compliance obligations that apply to Intervest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If we ever need to rely on consent, we will request it explicitly and you may withdraw it at any time.</p>

      <h2>8. AI features and human oversight</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>AIME includes an AI assistant to help users draft OKRs, summarise information, and interact with AIME and connected systems using natural language.</li>
        <li>Human-in-the-loop: the AI assistant may propose changes (e.g., create/update OKRs or Jira tickets), but actions are only executed after explicit user approval (Accept/Reject).</li>
        <li>Data minimisation for AI: the assistant is designed to retrieve and send only the data required to answer a user’s request, and it does not have direct database access.</li>
        <li>No autonomous decision-making: AIME is not intended to make automated decisions about individuals (e.g., hiring, disciplinary action, or performance evaluation).</li>
        <li>AI-generated content: where AIME displays AI-generated inspiration or text, it will be labelled (e.g., “Includes AI Generated Content”).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Sharing and processors</h2>
      <p>
        We may share personal data with authorised service providers (processors) to operate AIME,
        subject to contractual safeguards and access controls. Depending on configuration, this may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hosting and infrastructure providers (e.g., Vercel today; AWS planned).</li>
        <li>Database providers (e.g., Neon Postgres today; AWS RDS planned).</li>
        <li>AI inference provider (e.g., Amazon Bedrock and underlying model provider, if enabled).</li>
        <li>Enterprise systems and integrations (e.g., Atlassian Jira; Microsoft identity/SSO; Snowflake for KPI data), limited to what is required and authorised.</li>
        <li>Security, monitoring, and vulnerability management tools (e.g., Snyk), where adopted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell personal data and we do not use AIME for advertising or cross-site tracking.</p>

      <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        If personal data is accessed or processed outside the country/region where it originated
        (for example, EU/EEA users’ data processed in the UK or elsewhere), we will implement
        appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law. This may include contractual clauses,
        transfer impact assessments, and vendor controls.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy,
        including security, contractual, and legal requirements. Typical retention periods (subject to
        organisational policy) may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Goals/OKRs and related metadata: retained for operational history and planning purposes, then archived or deleted in line with retention schedules (retained up to one year).</li>
        <li>Audit/security logs: retained for a limited period to support security monitoring and incident investigation (one month).</li>
        <li>Integration references (Jira/KPI): we avoid duplicating source-system data unnecessarily and may occasionally cache them temporarily to improve application speed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Specific retention values will be documented in AIME’s retention schedule and Record of Processing Activities (RoPA).</p>

      <h2>12. Security</h2>
      <p>We implement administrative, technical, and organisational measures to protect personal data, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Authentication via Microsoft SSO and role-based access control (RBAC) aligned to organisational structure.</li>
        <li>Encryption in transit (TLS) and encryption at rest through managed service controls.</li>
        <li>Access logging/audit trails for key actions (including AI proposals and approvals, where configured).</li>
        <li>Least privilege access to integrations (scoped tokens) and secure secrets management.</li>
        <li>Vulnerability management (e.g., dependency scanning) and patching practices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>13. Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Where applicable data protection laws grant you rights, including access, rectification,
        erasure, restriction, objection, and data portability. To exercise these rights, contact
        the Data Protection Officer using the details above. We will respond within legally required
        timeframes.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
      <p>
        AIME uses essential cookies for authentication/session security and, where applicable,
        Microsoft SSO. AIME does not use cookies for advertising or cross-site tracking. Please refer
        to the AIME Cookie Use Policy for details.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Updates to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time to reflect legal, operational, or technological changes.
        The updated version will be made available within AIME (or via the relevant internal policy repository)
        with a revised “Last updated” date.
      </p>

      <h2>16. Questions and complaints</h2>
